🔹 Virtualization

Virtualization is a technology that allows multiple operating systems or environments
to run on a single physical machine by sharing hardware resources efficiently.
It helps in better resource utilization, isolation, and cost reduction.

🔹 Virtual Machine (VM)

A Virtual Machine is a software-based computer that runs inside a physical system.
Each VM has its own operating system and resources like CPU, RAM, and storage.
Examples of virtualization software:
1.VirtualBox
2.VMware

DOCKER Application
Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to create, run, and manage applications inside containers.

🔹 Why Docker is Needed?

Normally, an application may work on one system but not on another because of:
Different OS
Different software versions
Missing libraries
 Docker solves this problem.
With Docker:
“It works on my system” becomes
“It works everywhere”
