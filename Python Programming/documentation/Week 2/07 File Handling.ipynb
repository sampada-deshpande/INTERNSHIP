    "FILE HANDLING \n",
    "\n",
    "File handling refers to the process of performing operations on a file, such as creating, opening, reading, writing and closing it through a programming interface. It involves managing the data flow between the program and the file system on the storage device, ensuring that data is handled safely and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need File Handling\n",
    "To store data permanently, even after the program ends.\n",
    "To access external files like .txt, .csv, .json, etc.\n",
    "To process large files efficiently without using much memory.\n",
    "To automate tasks like reading configs or saving outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening a File\n",
    "To open a file, we can use open() function, which requires file-path and mode as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "file = open('filename.txt', 'mode')\n",
    "\n",
    " Example: Opening a File\n",
    "\n",
    "f = open(\"geek.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "print(f)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a File\n",
    "The file.close() method closes the file and releases the system resources. If the file was opened in write or append mode, closing ensures that all changes are properly saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "file = open(\"geek.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "# Perform file operations\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking File Properties\n",
    "Once the file is open, we can check some of its properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "f = open(\"geek.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "print(\"Filename:\", f.name)\n",
    "print(\"Mode:\", f.mode)\n",
    "print(\"Is Closed?\", f.closed)\n",
    "​\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "print(\"Is Closed?\", f.closed)\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Filename: geek.txt\n",
    "Mode: r\n",
    "Is Closed? False\n",
    "Is Closed? True\n",
    "\n",
    "Using with Statement\n",
    "Instead of manually opening and closing the file, you can use the with statement, which automatically handles closing. This reduces the risk of file corruption and resource leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "with open(\"geek.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, World!\n"
