What is a Function in Python?

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
Instead of writing the same code again and again, you write it once in a function and call it whenever needed.

 
 Why Use Functions?

 1.Reuse code

 2.Make code readable

 3.Easy to maintain & debug

 4.Break big programs into smaller parts

 Syntax of a Function
def function_name(parameters)
    """docstring (optional)"""
    statements
    return value   # optional

📝 Simple Example
def greet():
    print("Hello, welcome to Python!")

greet()


🔹 Output:

Hello, welcome to Python!

Types of Functions in Python

1️⃣ Built-in Functions

Already provided by Python.

Examples:

print("Hi")
len([1, 2, 3])
type(10)

2️⃣ User-defined Functions

Created by you using def.

def square(n):
    return n * n

3️⃣ Functions with No Arguments
def show():
    print("No arguments here")

show()

4️⃣ Functions with Arguments
def multiply(a, b):
    print(a * b)

multiply(3, 4)


A docstring
(short for documentation string) is a special string in Python used to describe what a module, function, class, or method does. It helps others (and you!) understand the code and is accessible at runtime.

✅ What makes a string a docstring?

It is written as the first statement inside a module, function, class, or method.

It uses triple quotes: """ ... """ (or ''' ... ''').

Python stores it in the __doc__ attribute.
