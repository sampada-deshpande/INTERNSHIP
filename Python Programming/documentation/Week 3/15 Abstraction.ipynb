    "Data abstraction means showing only the essential features and hiding the complex internal details.\n",
    "In Python abstraction is used to hide the implementation details from the user and expose only necessary parts, making the code simpler and easier to interact with.\n",
    "👉 The user knows what an object does,\n",
    "👉 but not how it does it\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need Abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Reduces complexity\n",

    "\n",
    "An Abstract Base Class (ABC) is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used to define a blueprint (structure) for other classes.\n",

    "👉 but it does not provide full implementation itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Why do we need an Abstract Base Class?\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ To enforce a common structure\n",
