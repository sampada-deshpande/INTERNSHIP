1️⃣ Topics Studied

1.Introduction to Virtualization
2.Need and Benefits of Virtualization
3.Virtual Machine (VM) basics
4.DOCKER Application
5.GitHub account creation
6.GitHub repository creation

🔹 Virtualization

Virtualization is a technology that allows multiple operating systems or environments
to run on a single physical machine by sharing hardware resources efficiently.
It helps in better resource utilization, isolation, and cost reduction.

🔹 Virtual Machine (VM)

A Virtual Machine is a software-based computer that runs inside a physical system.
Each VM has its own operating system and resources like CPU, RAM, and storage.
Examples of virtualization software:
1.VirtualBox
2.VMware

DOCKER Application
Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to create, run, and manage applications inside containers.

🔹 Why Docker is Needed?

Normally, an application may work on one system but not on another because of:
Different OS
Different software versions
Missing libraries
 Docker solves this problem.
With Docker:
“It works on my system” becomes
“It works everywhere”


Practical Work Done

1.Created a GitHub account
2.Learned about GitHub interface
3.Created a new GitHub repository
4.Understood repository components:
5.README.md
6.gitignore
7.Commit and Push concepts



 Objective of the Day
1.To understand all basic Python concepts
2.To apply them using small mini projects

Python Basics Concepts 

🔹 1. Introduction to Python
High-level programming language
Interpreted and easy to learn
Used in web development, data science, automation, AI

🔹 2. Python Syntax
Python uses indentation instead of braces
Code readability is very important
Example:
print("Hello Python")

🔹 3. Variables
Used to store data
No need to declare data type
Example:
name = "Sampada"
age = 20

🔹 4. Data Types
int
float
string
boolean
Example:

x = 10        # int
y = 2.5       # float
name = "ABC"  # string
is_valid = True  # boolean

🔹 5. Input and Output
input() is used to take user input
print() is used to display output
Example:

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)

🔹 6. Type Casting
Converting one data type to another
Example:
age = int(input("Enter age: "))

🔹 7. Operators
Arithmetic operators: + - * / %
Relational operators: > < == !=
Logical operators: and or not
Example:
a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)
print(a > b)

🔹 8. Comments
Used to explain code
Ignored by Python interpreter

EXAMPLES

#SIMPLE CALCULATOR
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

print("Addition:", a + b)
print("Subtraction:", a - b)
print("Multiplication:", a * b)
print("Division:", a / b)


#CURRENCY CONVERTER 
rupees = float(input("Enter amount in INR: "))
usd_rate = 0.012

usd = rupees * usd_rate

print("Amount in USD:", usd)

#EMPLOYEE BONUS CALCULATOR
salary = float(input("Enter salary: "))
years = int(input("Enter years of service: "))

if years >= 5:
    bonus = salary * 0.10
else:
    bonus = salary * 0.05

print("Bonus Amount:", bonus)
print("Total Salary:", salary + bonus)
