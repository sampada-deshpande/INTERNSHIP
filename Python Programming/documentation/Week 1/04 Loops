LOOPS IN Python

A loop in Python is a control flow statement used to repeat a specific block of code multiple times. Instead of writing the same line of code over and over, you use a loop to automate repetitive tasks efficiently.

Python primarily uses two types of loops: for loops and while loops.

1. THE FOR LOOP
A for loop is used for definite iteration. This means it repeats a block of code a specific number of times, usually by iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).

Syntax

for variable in sequence:
    statement

A for loop is used to iterate over:

list
tuple
string
range
dictionary

Example: for loop with range()
for i in range(5):
    print(i)


 Output:

0
1
2
3
4

#Key Components:

The Sequence: This can be a list, a string, or a range of numbers.
The Loop Variable: A temporary name (like item, i, or x) that takes the value of the current element in the sequence during each iteration.

Example: Iterating through a List

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
    print(x)

The range() Function
Often used with for loops to repeat code a specific number of times.
range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4.
range(2, 6) generates numbers from 2 to 5.

2.WHILE LOOP 

A while loop in Python is a control flow statement that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains True.

Think of it like a "continuous check." Before every cycle (iteration) of the loop, Python checks the condition. If it's true, the code runs. If it's false, the loop ends immediately.

 Syntax of a While Loop
The structure is simple, but indentation is critical in Python:

while condition:
    # code block to be executed


 How it works:
The Condition: This is a boolean expression (something that results in True or False).
The Execution: If the condition is True, the code inside the block runs.
The Loop: After the code runs, Python goes back to the top and checks the condition again.
The Exit: When the condition finally becomes False, Python skips the block and moves on to the rest of the program.

Example:
# 1. Initialization
count = 1 

# 2. Condition
while count <= 3:
    print("This is iteration number", count)
    
    # 3. Update (Increment)
    count = count + 1 

print("Loop finished!")

3. The Danger: Infinite Loops
An infinite loop occurs when the condition never becomes False. This usually happens if you forget to update your variable or if your logic is flawed.

Example of a mistake:
i = 1
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    # If we forget 'i += 1', 'i' stays 1 forever. 
    # The loop will print '1' until the program crashes.

    DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOR AND WHILE LOOP 

                             for loop	                        while loop
Meaning                 Iterates over a sequence	    Runs while a condition is true
Best used when	        Number of iterations is known	Number of iterations is unknown
Condition	            Implicit (inside sequence)	    Explicit condition required
Initialization	        Done automatically	            Must be done manually
Increment / Decrement	Automatic	                    Must be written by programmer
Risk of infinite loop	Very low	                    High (if condition not updated)


3.LOOP CONTROL Statements

Loop control statements change the execution of a loop from its normal sequence. In Python, these statements allow you to skip iterations, exit loops early, or handle empty code blocks.
There are three primary control statements: break, continue, and pass.

1. The break Statement
The break statement is used to terminate the loop entirely. When Python hits a break, it jumps out of the loop and moves to the next line of code outside the loop.

When to use it:
When you've found what you're looking for (e.g., searching a list).

To stop an infinite while True loop based on a specific condition.

Example:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

for num in numbers:
    if num == 4:
        print("Found 4! Stopping the loop.")
        break  # The loop stops here; 5 and 6 are never checked.
    print(f"Checking: {num}")

print("Loop is over.")

2. The continue Statement
The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next cycle of the loop. Unlike break, it does not stop the loop; it just "jumps over" the code remaining in the current block for that specific turn.

When to use it:
When you want to skip specific items (e.g., skipping even numbers or ignoring errors).

Example:

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        print("Skipping 3")
        continue  # Jumps back to the top of the loop for i=4
    print(f"Processing number: {i}")

Output:

Processing number: 1
Processing number: 2
Skipping 3
Processing number: 4
Processing number: 5

3. The pass Statement
The pass statement is a null operation. It literally does nothing. In Python, empty code blocks (like an empty if or loop) cause a syntax error. pass acts as a placeholder.

When to use it:
When you are sketching out code and haven't written the logic yet.
To fulfill syntax requirements without executing any logic.

Example:

for x in [1, 2, 3]:
    if x == 2:
        pass # I'll add logic for '2' later, for now just do nothing
    else:
        print(x)

Statement           Effect on Loop                      Why use it?
break        Stops the entire loop immediately.    Exit early once a goal is met.
continue     Skips only the current turn.          Filter out specific items without stopping.
pass         Does nothing at all.                  Placeholder to prevent syntax errors.


4.NESTED LOOPS 

What is a Nested Loop?
A nested loop is simply a loop inside another loop. The "inner loop" will execute all its iterations for every single iteration of the "outer loop."

Think of it like a clock: the hour hand (outer loop) only moves once after the minute hand (inner loop) has completed a full circle of 60 minutes.

1. Basic Syntax
You can nest any type of loop inside any other type (e.g., a while loop inside a for loop).

for outer_variable in outer_sequence:
    # Code in the outer loop
    for inner_variable in inner_sequence:
        # Code in the inner loop
        # This runs multiple times for each outer_variable

2. Practical Example: A Multiplications Table
This is the most common way to visualize how nested loops work.

# Outer loop
for i in range(1, 4): # i will be 1, then 2, then 3
    # Inner loop
    for j in range(1, 4): # j will go 1, 2, 3 for EVERY i
        print(f"{i} * {j} = {i*j}")
    print("--- End of inner loop ---")

What happens here?

i starts at 1.
The inner loop runs completely: 1*1, 1*2, 1*3.
i moves to 2.
The inner loop runs completely again: 2*1, 2*2, 2*3.
This continues until the outer loop finishes.

Key Rules to Remember

Execution Count: The total number of times the inner code runs is the (Outer Iterations) × (Inner Iterations).
 If the outer loop runs 5 times and the inner runs 10, the inner code executes 50 times.
 Performance (Big O): Be careful! Nested loops can make your program slow if the datasets are large. 
 In computer science, this is often referred to as $O(n^2)$ complexity.Variable Names: Always use different names for the loop variables (e.g., i and j, or row and col). 
 Using the same name will cause the inner loop to overwrite the outer loop's value

 Control Statements in Nested Loops

A common point of confusion is how break and continue work inside nested loops:
break: Only breaks out of the innermost loop it is currently in. The outer loop will continue to run.

continue: Only skips the rest of the innermost loop's current iteration.

Example of break in Nested Loops:

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(10):
        if j == 2:
            break # This stops the 'j' loop, but 'i' keeps going
        print(i, j)
