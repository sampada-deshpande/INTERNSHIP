    "LOOPS IN Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A loop in Python is a control flow statement used to repeat a specific block of code multiple times. Instead of writing the same line of code over and over, you use a loop to automate repetitive tasks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python primarily uses two types of loops: for loops and while loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. THE FOR LOOP\n",
    "A for loop is used for definite iteration. This means it repeats a block of code a specific number of times, usually by iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A for loop is used to iterate over:\n",
    "\n",
    "list\n",
    "tuple\n",
    "string\n",
    "range\n",
    "dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: for loop with range()\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "\n",
    "#Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sequence: This can be a list, a string, or a range of numbers.\n",
    "The Loop Variable: A temporary name (like item, i, or x) that takes the value of the current element in the sequence during each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Iterating through a List\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "for x in fruits:\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "The range() Function\n",
    "Often used with for loops to repeat code a specific number of times.\n",
    "range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4.\n",
    "range(2, 6) generates numbers from 2 to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.WHILE LOOP \n",
    "\n",
    "A while loop in Python is a control flow statement that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a \"continuous check.\" Before every cycle (iteration) of the loop, Python checks the condition. If it's true, the code runs. If it's false, the loop ends immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    " Syntax of a While Loop\n",
    "The structure is simple, but indentation is critical in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " How it works:\n",
    "The Condition: This is a boolean expression (something that results in True or False).\n",
    "The Execution: If the condition is True, the code inside the block runs.\n",
    "The Loop: After the code runs, Python goes back to the top and checks the condition again.\n",
    "The Exit: When the condition finally becomes False, Python skips the block and moves on to the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# 1. Initialization\n",
    "count = 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Condition\n",
    "while count <= 3:\n",
    "    print(\"This is iteration number\", count)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # 3. Update (Increment)\n",
    "    count = count + 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Loop finished!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Danger: Infinite Loops\n",
    "An infinite loop occurs when the condition never becomes False. This usually happens if you forget to update your variable or if your logic is flawed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a mistake:\n",
    "i = 1\n",
    "while i < 5:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    # If we forget 'i += 1', 'i' stays 1 forever. \n",
    "    # The loop will print '1' until the program crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOR AND WHILE LOOP \n",
    "\n",
    "                           for loop\t                        while loop\n",
    "Meaning                  Iterates over a sequence\t    Runs while a condition is true\n",
    "Best used when\t        Number of iterations is known\tNumber of iterations is unknown\n",
    "Condition\t            Implicit (inside sequence)\t    Explicit condition required\n",
    "Initialization\t        Done automatically\t            Must be done manually\n",
    "Increment / Decrement\tAutomatic\t                    Must be written by programmer\n",
    "Risk of infinite loop\tVery low\t                    High (if condition not updated)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.LOOP CONTROL Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop control statements change the execution of a loop from its normal sequence. In Python, these statements allow you to skip iterations, exit loops early, or handle empty code blocks.\n",
    "There are three primary control statements: break, continue, and pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The break Statement\n",
    "The break statement is used to terminate the loop entirely. When Python hits a break, it jumps out of the loop and moves to the next line of code outside the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use it:\n",
    "When you've found what you're looking for (e.g., searching a list).\n",
    "\n",
    "To stop an infinite while True loop based on a specific condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE:\n"
